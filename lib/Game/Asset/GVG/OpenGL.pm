=head1 NAME

  Game::Asset::GVG::OpenGL - Load GVG files from a Game::Asset archive and convert to OpenGL 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $asset = Game::Asset->new({
        file => 't_data/test.zip',
    });
    my $opengl = $asset->get_by_name( 'test' );
    
    my $opengl_obj = $opengl->opengl;
    # Setup an OpenGL context, then do:
    $opengl_obj->draw;


    # In your index.yml for the Game::Asset archive, add:
    gvg: Game::Asset::GVG::OpenGL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Game::Asset> loads files and gives them to you as Perl objects. 
L<Graphics::GVG::OpenGLRenderer> takes GVG files and turns them into a Perl 
class that can be used to render the vectors in OpenGL. This module glues the 
two together.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 opengl

Returns the object which can be used to draw the data in the GVG file using 
OpenGL. Once an OpenGL context is set, you can call C<draw()> on this 
object to draw the GVG.
